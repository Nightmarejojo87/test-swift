# Swift Development Course Template

Welcome, Students!

This repository is your starting point for the Swift / iOS Development course. It is pre-configured to run a full Swift environment in the cloud (GitHub Codespaces), allowing you to build Swift applications—including UI apps—without needing a Mac.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Do not clone this directly. Follow these steps to set up your personal workspace:

#### 1. Create your Repo:
1. Click the green "Use this template" button at the top right of this page.
2. Select "Create a new repository".
3. Name it according to the assignment instructions (e.g., assignment-1-yourname).

#### 2. Launch the Environment:
Once your new repository is created:
1. click the green <> Code button.
2. Switch to the Codespaces tab.
3. Click "Create codespace on main".

Wait about 2-3 minutes. GitHub is building a Linux container with Swift 6.2 and all necessary VS Code extensions pre-installed for you.

## 🛠 What's Included?
